Power series for e^x

I found out most calculators use power series like these, so I tried making a recreation of one in java. Theoretically, any x value should be able to used since the interval of convergence for e^x's power series is infinity, but the program isn't always accurate with larger numbers. I don't think it's a problem with the code, rather java simplifying some of the math to make it faster. But it works for most reasonable numbers. As long as "accuracy" stays under 15-20 it works fine.

I also wrote the factorial function from scratch to practice some recursive looping. It's what we're working on in class right now and it's really simple so I thought I'd integrate some of that.
